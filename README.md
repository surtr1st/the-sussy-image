# The Sussy Image

## Project Idea

Sometimes, you collect images on the internet or store your images in some folder but cannot remember which images you have downloaded.
Because of storing images that you have downloaded but can't recall, it could increase disk space usage if the image folder size is tremendously high.
This app provides some options that could help with your problem.

## Technologies Used

- [Vue 3 + Vite](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

## Description

The functionality of checking the duplicate is based on the hash function of itself.
Although this could help for some particular cases, it still cannot check the inevitable cases like:
- Files edited
- Identical to the original but the bitmap, resolution was changed

## Issues

The app was flawed, the performance was a bit bad, and the options sometimes malfunctioned.
