# Image Diff

## Project Idea

Sometimes, you collect images on the internet or store your images in some folder but cannot remember which images you have downloaded.
Because of storing images that you have downloaded but can't recall, it could increase disk space usage if the image folder size is tremendously high.
This app provides some options that will help with your problem.
